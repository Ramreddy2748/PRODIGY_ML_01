**Linear Regression Model**

Prediction of SalePrice using different features like  **year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms**


Plot of **Distribution of SalePrice**
In this we used a **SEABORN** for platting Saleprice

We have also plot an Correlation Heatmap using a **SEABORN**
## Correlation Heatmap for Some Numerical Columns

By using **scatterplot** we have plotted between **OverallQual** and **SalePrice**
